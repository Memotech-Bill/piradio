# Some Components of an Internet Radio

This repository collects some of the software I am
using to assemble a simple Internet Radio using
[Music Player Daemon](https://mpd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user.html)
and assorted hardware I had lying around.

The main hardware components are:

*   Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
*   Raspberry Pi Pico
*   Pimoroni [PHAT-BEAT](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-phat-beat)
*   Epson EA-C20017AR 1x20 LCD Display

This is a work in progress.
